Todo:
- Collect feedback
- Improve descriptions/guides and topic
- icons for for the different switches
- Better readme (how to obtain the different event types)
- Collapsible based on choice of what kind of switch you use. (a dropdown so the right switchs options will be collapsed)
- Other ideas from this topic. please feel free to ask or give tips.
- Add more switches (give me the brand, model, and options/event types (in develop tools, like: event_types: hold, button_1_release, button_1_single, button_1_double, button_1_triple, button_2_release, button_2_single, button_2_double, etc. etc...)
